/**
 * @summary Construct a type with the properties of `ObjectLike` picked from those in type `KeysUnion`.
 * @template ObjectLike An object-like type or interface from which some keys are to be picked.
 * @template KeysUnion A union of keys that may or may not be present in the ObjectLike generic, used to pick keys from the created type.
 * @description Very similar to TS's built-in {@link Pick} utility type (@see {@link https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#picktype-keys built-in TS Pick}) with 3 key differences:
 * - 1. The first generic is limited to object-like types;
 * - 2. In the second generic, the keys to be picked don't necessarily have to extend the keys of `ObjectLike` -- still, loose autocomplete is provided;
 * - 3. If no valid keys are picked, the result is {@link EmptyObject} - not {@link Object}.
 *
 * Opposite of {@link LooseOmit}.
 *
 * Loose version of {@link StrictPick}.
 * @example
 * ```
 * type FooBarBazz = {
 *   foo: string;
 *   bar: string;
 *   bazz: string;
 * };
 *
 * type Foo = LooseOmit<FooBarBazz, 'foo' | 'gabagoobaa'>
 * /*    ___________________________         ^
 *       | No error here but shows |         |
 *       | 'foo' | 'bar' | 'bazz'  | ---------
 *       | for autocomplete.       |
 *       ---------------------------
 * /*
 * ```
 * **Result:**
 * ```
 * type Foo = {
 *   foo: string;
 * };
 * ```
 * @todo
 *
 * **Issue #1:**
 * As of now, this type may not work correctly with Maps or Sets.
 *
 * **Issue #2:**
 * Arrays can be passed into `ObjectLike` generic -- there's a rather simple way to change this and it needs to happen soon.
 *
 * **Issue 3:**
 * No autocomplete for `KeysUnion` number and symbol keys -- only for strings.
 * An attempt to fix that will first be conducted in {@link EXPERIMENTAL_LooseOmit}.
 * But there is a case to be made that types should be created for Omit and Pick types (both Loose and Strict varieties) that *ONLY* accept strings for object keys in the `KeysUnion`.
 * Using numbers as keys is plainly bad practice and using symbols is rare enough that using the wide {@link PropertyKey} type for keys in these utilities -- while strictly more "correct" -- will probably lead to more confusion than it's worth.
 * We shall see...
 * @see
 * Types used under the hood:
 * - Internal: {@link LoosePickHelper};
 * - Helpers: {@link LooseAutocomplete}, {@link EmptyObject};
 * - Built-in TS Utilities: {@link PropertyKey}, {@link Record}.
